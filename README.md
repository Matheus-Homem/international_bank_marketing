## Data Source <a name="paragraph1"></a>
The data used in this project is fictitious and were taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata).

## Business Problem <a name="introduction"></a>
International Bank is an international bank that provides financial products such as loans, checking accounts, savings accounts, investment options, credit cards and so on.

Every quarter of the year, the leaders meet to decide the company's goals for the next 3 months. At this last meeting, one of the goals decided was to create a marketing strategy to approach customers who use credit cards.

The company has a dataset on the usage behavior of approximately 9,000 active credit card users during the last 6 months and the file is at the customer level and has 18 behavioral variables.

### Project Goals <a name="goal"></a>
1. Create customer segmentation based on clear selection criteria.
2. Make customer segmentation accessible to the operations team.
3. Teach the operations team how to use your solution.
4. Transfer knowledge to International Bank Data Scientists.
5. Recommend 2-3 business levers for each customer segment.

### Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
The project is not finished yet.

## Project Scope <a name="scope"></a>
- The project is divided into cycles according to the CRISP-DM methodology, and is organized as follows:

### [Cycle 0: Planning](https://github.com/Matheus-Homem/international_bank_marketing/blob/main/notebooks/c0_planning.ipynb) <a name="c0"></a>
- Use of the IoT method for project description:
  - Inputs: what was given to carry out the project;
  - Outputs: what will be delivered at the end of the project;
  - Tasks: what will be done;
- Cycles To-Do List

### [Cycle 1: End to End Solution](https://github.com/Matheus-Homem/international_bank_marketing/blob/main/notebooks/c1_end_to_end_solution.ipynb) <a name="c1"></a>
- Elaboration of the entire project solution as simple as possible to check for possible obstacles.

### [Cycle 2: Metrics and Data Analysis](https://github.com/Matheus-Homem/international_bank_marketing/blob/main/notebooks/c2_metrics_and_data_analysis.ipynb) <a name="c2"></a>
- Have a better selection of features for the final model and analyze the clustered data with greater precision.

### [Cycle 3: Feature Engineering](https://github.com/Matheus-Homem/international_bank_marketing/blob/main/notebooks/c3_feature_engineering.ipynb) <a name="c3"></a>
- Selection of best features in order to obtain better clusters compared to other cycles.

### [Cycle 4: Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/Matheus-Homem/international_bank_marketing/blob/main/notebooks/c4_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb) <a name="c4"></a>
- Develop data analysis, thus promoting greater understanding of the business and improving decision making.

### [Cycle 5: Data Space Study](https://github.com/Matheus-Homem/international_bank_marketing/blob/main/notebooks/c5_data_space_study.ipynb) <a name="c5"></a>
- Creation of data spaces using different techniques, thus generating another way of creating clusters.

### [Cycle 6: Clustering Models](https://github.com/Matheus-Homem/international_bank_marketing/blob/main/notebooks/c6_clustering_models.ipynb) <a name="c6"></a>
- Addition of new clustering models and comparison of models following a given metric.
